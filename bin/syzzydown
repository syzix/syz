# The idea here is that this will undo what's done by syzzyup.
# Then the syz syzfile will call legacy-script to do syzzyup at load,
# and syzzydown at unload.
# Then this can facilitate using "syz swap" to change syz versions,
# including to a new/different implementation of the base 'syz' shell function.

# But it actually turns out that there's nothing to undo.
# - $PATH will be updated by the syzfile itself
# - $TCLLIBPATH is a modext thing, handled by that package's syzfile
# - $MODULEPATH shouldn't ever have the base repos removed from it
# - $LOADEDMODULES should be initialised if it's not present, but never fiddled with after that
# - Even the 'syz' shell function could be unset (in preparation for the incoming definition
#   in the new syz version that's about to be loaded), but what's the point? - when the new shell
#   function is defined, it will simply override the old one.  Leaving the 'syz' function alone
#   increases the chances of things continuing to work in the face of errors mid-way, etc.

# So, should this file stay, in case something comes up in the future?
# Or should it be turfed...??
