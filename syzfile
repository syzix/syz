#%Module

# These prereqs don't (yet) guarantee that these modules won't be unloaded.
# One idea would be when a prereq is done, set a special envvar which (somehow)
# tells that module that it's depended on by something.  Aha, a counter which is
# incremented each time a module is prereq'd.  Then, on load, counter decremented.
# Then, module can only be unloaded if its counter is non-existant or 0.  Circular
# prereq dep chains aren't possible, so circular structures wrecking reference
# counters isn't a concern.

# Well, better than a counter would be a colon-separated list of the modules
# that depend on it.  Then the error message can be more useful.
